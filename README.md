# Bullet

A bullet journaling and life-logging app built using the Flutter framework.

Keep track of daily activities like exercise, coffee consumption, sleep, and more. 

Mostly an excuse to play around with Flutter, personal data modeling, life logging, 
encryption, data privacy, and journaling interfaces. Still very much a prototype.
